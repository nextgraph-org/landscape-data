> Build local-first, collaborative and decentralized apps, with CRDTs, and end-to-end encryption.

## Framework and Platform

NextGraph brings about the convergence of P2P and Semantic Web technologies, towards a decentralized, secure and privacy-preserving cloud, based on CRDTs.

This open source ecosystem provides solutions for end-users (a platform) and software developers (a framework), wishing to use or create decentralized apps featuring: live collaboration on rich-text documents, peer-to-peer communication with end-to-end encryption, offline-first, local-first, portable and interoperable data, total ownership of data and software, security and privacy. Centered on repositories containing semantic data (RDF), rich text, and structured data formats like JSON, synced between peers belonging to permissioned groups of users, it offers strong eventual consistency, thanks to the use of CRDTs. Documents can be linked together, signed, shared securely, queried using the SPARQL language and organized into sites and containers.

## Features

- **Linked Data**: link documents and data together with RDF and DID URIs, then query all your data with SPARQL. Comaptible with Solid.
- **Social Network**: NextGraph offers decentralized social network features (DM, timeline, share). Compatible with ActivityPub
- **Portable & Interoperable**: Your data always remains under your control. It isn't tied to a specific app, format, domain name or server.
- **Malleable Software**: switch viewers and editors and reuse them at will. Enjoy ready-made components that can be reused.
- **Local-first**: Your data is stored locally, ensuring availability and privacy.
- **End-to-end encrypted**: All documents are encrypted in the client, and the servers (brokers) cannot see their content.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on all major platforms.
- **Open-source**: The code is available for anyone to use and contribute to, in permissive licensing.
